					<p>
						<br>
						We are Umass Boston freshmen from the Computer Science A FSC. This is what we worked on this semester. After learning the basics of HTML and CSS, we dove in to our website. This petition page was not our first website, our first idea, a website that represented the majors at UMB and had classes one would need to take to graduate, seemed tedious. It was an idea that would of left us searching for information rather than coding. So we chose to ditch the idea for something that would have us coding more than researching.

					<h3>Issues We Encountered</h3>
					<p>
						1) Assigning roles - We had 4 people so we had to figure out a way we could all share our changes. We used Google Drives to solve this issue and had all our code in a Google Doc.
						<br>
						<br>
						2) The "submit" algorithm we had was not working as planned. We could not find a way to output our user's input to the Sign page. [SOLUTION] We found out the reason for this was because we were not a hosted website on a server. Therefore the PHP code we had created was deemed useless. Our solution was to use pre-made template code to give an illusion on how our Sign web page was supposed to look.
						<br>
						<br>
						3) Right now, there is no actual way of preventing one person from signing a petition more than once. There will be a solution in the future, but for now we have made a seperate page that redirects the user to a thank you page after signing a petition.
						<br>
						<br>
						4) The Counter for a single petition has been removed from the public. This was done to prevent the user from non stop clicking the "Sign this Petition!" button and instead making the process longer. We can't seem to find a way to make it stay on a webpage, but it is stored in the websites code and do not reset until the website is demolished.
